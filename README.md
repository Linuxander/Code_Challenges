# Code Challenges

Welcome to my code challenge repository.  Here, I will host some of the code challenges I've worked on and write up about my approaches to the solutions I developed.  Throughout time, I will update some of these solutions with performance improvements and document how they improve the solution's runtime.

I answer most of these code challenges from websites like LeetCode or CodeSignal.  You will also find miscellaneous code challenges for job applications that I've completed.
